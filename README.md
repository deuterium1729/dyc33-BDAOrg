Hello this is a change. I am a freshman in the College of Arts and Sciences majoring in statistics, computer science, and mathematics. I am very interested applying data analysis to the growing field of bioinformatics. 
I would like to use the powerful tools of various machine learning algorithms to harness large sets of field data and make accurate predictions that will be the basis for coorporate or governmental decision making.
I am taking this course because of how crucial Bayesian inferencing is in the fields of artificial intelligence and machine learning, as the end goals of each are synonymous in many ways. It will be an important
tool and mindset to have as I pursue a degree in statistics.
